# Introduction

InnoWATT, a solution running on the Elrond blockchain that enables prosumers in residential areas to sell surplus energy to customers or store it for future trading.

INNOWATT is a virtual power plant by which resources are delegated and deployed in co-ownership with members of the network. It will have a NFT based ownership contract, legalised smart meters readings, and job slots that you can mine by your device. It represents the OS of the distributed grid.

Local microgrids evolve to accommodate electrification and charging needs where storage stations of all sizes will become omnipresent,even in residential areas. By decentralizing the grid and going towards dedicated micro units held by community, they can control and protect themselves from centralized energy producers and most importantly,from power blackouts. 
Decentralized energy systems can be an additional measure to the existing centralized ones: they can provide safety, decarbonization and lower energy prices therefore, a workaround for a better quality of life.

# Value Proposition

Merging blockchain technology with electrical storage stations can create a truly decentralized network that enables prosumers to sell surplus energy to the increasing e-mobility sector with better profitability and transparency.

Surplus energy can be sold for a more profitable price by the final customer. INOWATT can truly enable households to provide energy to anyone, anytime, in any volume.

The Elrond blockchain has all built-in components allowing for scaling a decentralized storage solution for the European market: security, transparency, adaptive state sharding at all levels, smart contracts on a sharded state architecture and insignificant transaction costs.


The decentralized network targets homeowners who possess : 
- electricity production installations from renewable sources
- storage units with an installed capacity of no more than 100 kW per place of consumption (node). 

# Virtual Power Plant Units
Our decentralized system relies on distributed generation, storage and demand response optimisation.

### Distributed Generation
Energy generation is the key part of decentralisation. Deploying large-scale systems has proved not to be feasible with the current resource distribution because centralised plants are often located nowhere near the existing transmission lines, and constructing transport lines to power the final-user is not always achievable. 
Distribution of generation units in the proximity of the consumer can improve costs and deploy stability through smaller and more granular investments. Diversification of energy sources can generate higher stability. Not depending on a monolithic grid with a singular point of entry , by which the feeding is usually made,distributed PV root surfaces make this process more flexible, due to its capacity to access multiple entry points.

### Distributed Storage
Renewable sources' production times don't match with the consumer peak times and that's why a buffer for both is required. In the old centralised plants, distributed storage was not such a strong requirement, mainly because if the consumers did not drain energy,then by an on-off switch less fossil fuel was used to run the plant, so no resources were lost.
With renewables, this is no longer available; production peeks can't be easily predicted and they depend on weather and regional conditions. Storage in distributed plants provides this extra buffer for storing extra energy and extra power peeks in case of need. 
Scheduled storage units run discharging and charging on demand to optimise the grid performance, with respect to loss of energy and return of investments for generation units.

### The Optimisation of Demand Response 
Demand response optimisation becomes the central component of the virtual power plant. In order to minimise the energy waste running in the network, the problem is reduced to a combinatorial optimisation problem. More specifically, it can be perceived as a more sophisticated and ample assignment problem. Given the demands for specific time slots, the consumers respectively, that together with the producers available to satisfy those demands, the optimisation consists in assigning the producers to the consumers, so that the energy waste in the system becomes minimal whilst maximising the satisfaction of the overall network members. This assignment also considers  the price constraint, the consumer specifying the maximal price it’s willing to accept per kilowatt, while the producer the minimal price it’s willing to sell for, the final price decided being the average, simulating therefore the self-adjusting behavior of a free market. 
This constrained assignment optimisation problem described above is approached as a mixed integer programming problem. The solver considered to be compatible for this feat is one of the fastest academically developed mixed integer programming solvers, namely SCIP(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-008-0001-1), by which the algorithm is being adapted/extended in order to optimise the matter concerned.

### Vesting 
- Ecosystem Rewards: 7.00% — 50% at IEO and 50% 6 months after IEO.
- Marketing/Grants/Accelerator Pool: 8.50% — • 81,17% at the IEO, 9,41% every 6 months after IEO.
- Team: 19.00% — Locked until 2020 with 3.5 years vesting period: 10% — 6 months after IEO, 10% — 12 months after IEO, another 15% — 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after IEO, 20% — 42 months after IEO. To show our commitment, the team has agreed to postpone unlocking team tokens until 6 months after IEO, and has extended the vesting to 3.5 years.
- Private Round: 19.00%— 7.5% unlocked at IEO, remaining 92.5% unlocks 15.42% every quarter over 18 months. Early supporters and private investors are a very important part of Elrond ecosystem and should be here for the long-term, so aligning interests between private investors and team are instrumental for long-term value creation. Therefor an increase in vesting was also added to the private investors.

			
 Mining tokens if you have the sistem running.
 We start from 7000000, which is the ecosystem's pole, we split it by 365, because we began the calculation considering the power that we intend to obtain during the first 365 days(100mwats). The result is 7000000/365=19178.0822 reward/day, that splits by the number  of units installed.100mwat = 20000 units. => for a complete initial grid would result 19178/20000=0.95890411 daowat/ unita/day, at a retail prce of 0.5$ => 0.95890411*0.5$=0.47945205$
 To each unit in addition to the 20000 ones, daowat of the capacity of unit entering the grid is mined.
 The next step is finding the relevance of the token to the maturity of the grid when inflation has gone.

# Market and Regulators
European Union
The political guidelines of the European Commission 2019-2024 (von der Leyen 2019) emphasize the urgency of leading the transition to a healthy and new digital world, addressing the challenges of Europe being the first climate-neutral continent (Commission priority ‘A European Green Deal’ 3 ) and the transformations brought about by digital technologies (Commission priority ‘A Europe fit for the digital age 4 ). “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 requires higher shares of renewable energy and greater energy efficiency in an integrated energy system”. 
	Each country has been allocated funds in PNRR  for research and deployments of new enhanced smart grids and smart cities. INOWATT project is not targeting a disruptive market but an emerging and transformation period in the European Union's interests and politics. It follows shared trends in political and environmental policies with all EU countries and strives to hit the targets for general decarbonisation. Each country has been allocated funds in PNRR  for research and deployments of new enhanced smart grids and smart cities.

Our community will provide you with a lower installation tax for storage and production equipment. It will be a platform for co-ownership and distributed investments.If every holder invests in his own infrastructure without servicing other members of the grid, his return of investment will exceed a period of 10 years. With INOWAT the returning can be achieved in half the time ~5 years. 


The community is settling on transparent pricing. The providers can achieve an optimal production price and green energy stored for later use whilts the consumers lower their usage of fossil energy sources.
5 KWH deployed units, that can be used for buying or selling energy.

Buying at peak generation time for 0.07KW/h  and then selling at 0.15KW/h at peak consumption time generates a profit of 0,4 Euros/hour, with an average peek generation period of 5 hours per day, which means. This is only PV.

2 Euros/day
62Euros/Month,
744 Euros/Year
If also Wind and Hydro are collected, then multiple charges/discharges cycles per day are required, making it possible to double your profits.
If there is a possibility for storage users to sell, consumers will be incentivised with lower prices

Let's imagine we have a lower price of 0.02EUR/KWh and a higher price paid by the final-user at 0.2 EUR/KWh. Using a storage unit that buys and sells at 0.11EUR/KWh, there is an incentive for all 3 parties to join the community and play their role in the grid orchestration. An extra 0.11EUR/KW economy is felt by each actor involved.
For a normal household, the average consumption of energy is around 


In the first half of 2021, average household electricity prices in the EU increased slightly compared with the same period of 2020 (€21.3 per 100 kWh), standing at €21.9 per 100 kWh. At 0.22 euro cents for KW means your battery can provide you 1.1 $ per discharge. The battery price is around 4000$, means it will buy out in 3636.36. Doing the math ignores the lifetime and the discharge percentage, if you cycle it to 100% your lifetime dramatically reduces - for 5KW discharging 100% - a number of 600 discharge cycles can be made. If you would discharge just 50% 3,000 discharge cycles can be possible. There is another aspect in the voltage of the cells inside batteries, and, if tunned properly, it can  significantly prolong the life of the battery.
